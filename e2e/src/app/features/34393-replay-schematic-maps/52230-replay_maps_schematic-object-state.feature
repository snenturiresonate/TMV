Feature: 34393 - Replay page Schematic Object State Scenarios
  (From Gherkin for Feature 40680 and functionality developed in US34081)
  As a TMV User
  I want the view schematic maps in replay mode
  So that I can view the historic running railway

  Background:
    And I am on the replay page
    When I expand the replay group of maps with name 'Wales & Western'
    And I select the map 'HDGW01 Paddington'
    And I select Start

  Scenario: 34393-7 Current Signal State
    #Given the existing state of the signals
    #And at least one signal has a known state
    #When the user opens a new map that contains the signals
    #Then the signal state align with the underlying signal state model
    Given I set up all signals for address 80 in D3 to be red
    And the maximum amount of time is allowed for end to end transmission
    And the signal roundel for signal 'SN208' is red
    When I launch a new map 'HDGW02' the new map should have start time from the moment it was opened
    And I switch to the new tab
    Then the signal roundel for signal 'SN200' is red
    And I refresh the browser
    And the signal roundel for signal 'SN200' is red


  Scenario:34393-8 Main Signal State (Proceed)
    #Given an S-Class message is received and processed
    #And the S-Class message is associated with a main signal
    #And the S-Class message is setting the main signal to proceed
    #When a user is viewing a map that contains the main signal
    #Then the main signal will display a proceed aspect (green roundel)
    And I set up all signals for address 80 in D3 to be not-proceed
    When the following signalling update message is sent from LINX
      | trainDescriber | address | data | timestamp |
      | D3             | 80      | 00   | 10:45:00  |
    And the maximum amount of time is allowed for end to end transmission
    Then the signal roundel for signal 'SN128' is red
    When the following signalling update message is sent from LINX
      | trainDescriber | address | data | timestamp |
      | D3             | 80      | FF   | 10:45:00  |
    And the maximum amount of time is allowed for end to end transmission
    Then the signal roundel for signal 'SN128' is green

  Scenario:34393-9 Main Signal State (Not Proceed)
    #Given an S-Class message is received and processed
    #And the S-Class message is associated with a main signal
    #And the S-Class message is setting the main signal to not proceed
    #When a user is viewing a map that contains the main signal
    #Then the main signal will display a not proceed aspect (red roundel)
    And I set up all signals for address 80 in D3 to be proceed
    When the following signalling update message is sent from LINX
      | trainDescriber | address | data | timestamp |
      | D3             | 80      | FF   | 10:45:00  |
    Then the signal roundel for signal 'SN128' is green
    When the following signalling update message is sent from LINX
      | trainDescriber | address | data | timestamp |
      | D3             | 80      | 00   | 10:45:00  |
    And the maximum amount of time is allowed for end to end transmission
    Then the signal roundel for signal 'SN128' is red
