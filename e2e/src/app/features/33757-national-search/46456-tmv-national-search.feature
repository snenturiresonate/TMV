Feature: 33757 - TMV National Search

  As a TMV dev team member
  I want end to end tests to be created for the National Search functionality
  So that there is confidence that it continues to work as expected as more of the system is developed

  Background:
    * I remove all trains from the trains list

  Scenario Outline: 33757-1a Train search window shown - Train Search entering trainUid - <pageName>
    #Given the user is authenticated to use TMV
    #And the user is viewing TMV screen with a national search in the title bar
    #When the user selects a train search option (default)
    #And the user enters at least two alphanumeric characters
    #And the user submits the search
    #Then the trains search results list is displayed with zero or many results
    Given I navigate to <pageName> page
    And the Train Search Box has the value 'Train Desc, Trust ID, Planning UID'
    And the access plan located in CIF file 'access-plan/1L24_PADTON_RDNGSTN.cif' is received from LINX
    And I wait until today's train 'A12345' has loaded
    And I give the timetable an extra 2 seconds to load
    And the following live berth interpose message is sent from LINX (to create a match)
