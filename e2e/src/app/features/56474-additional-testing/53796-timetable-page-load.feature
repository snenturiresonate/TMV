Feature: 33753 - Timetable - Additional Automated Testing - Timetable NFR Testing - Page Load

  Automated testing deferred from initial contract work

  Background:
    * I reset the stopwatch
    * I remove all trains from the trains list
    * I generate a new trainUID
    * I generate a new train description
    * I delete 'generated:today' from hash 'schedule-modifications-today'
    * I am on the home page
    * I restore to default train list config '1'

  #  Given the user is authenticated to use TMV
  #  And the user is viewing the trains list
  #  When the user selects a train from the trains list using the secondary mouse click
  #  And selects the "open timetable" option from the menu
  #  Then the train's timetable is opened in a new browser tab within 1 second
  #
  #  Notes:
  #  From Trains List, only matched services will be able to Open Timetable â€“ unmatched will not have this option.
